# stardew-profits-options
 User script to save Stardew-Profits options without relying on the URL parameters, letting you bookmark the main page (https://thorinair.github.io/Stardew-Profits/index.html) while keeping all of your options.

Built for ViolentMonkey - other user script managers (TamperMonkey, GreaseMonkey) have not been tested.
